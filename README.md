# Operating-Systems
One of the operating system functions is to manage the programs.  Most operating systems now are multitasking, meaning you can have multiple programs running at once. An example would be that you could have multiple web browsers open while using word documents.  When you running multiple programs one will be the foreground while the others will be in the background.  Foreground is the active program youre currently using.
Coordinating tasks on the operating system determines the order that tasks are processed. Tasks include recieving data from an input device, sendinf information to an output device, processing instructions, transfering items from storage to memory and memory to storage.  For example if you were downloading music and started downloading more music, the operating system would have to put the next songs in its memory until the first download is completed.  This area of memory that the download is stored in is a buffer.
